## Classical Numerical Analysis

<img src="https://github.com/stevenmwise/stevenmwise.github.io/blob/master/files/9781108837705ppc.pdf">

### Synopsis

**Classical Numerical Analysis: A Comprehensive Course** (CNA) is our new book (2023) on numerical analysis aimed at graduate and advanced undergraduate students and published by Cambridge University Press. Written by my colleague, [Abner Salgado](https://sites.google.com/utk.edu/abnersg/), and myself, CNA is our attempt to make numerical analysis accessible and understandable to a modern audience. The following is the back-cover blurb for the book:

Numerical Analysis is a broad field, and coming to grips with all of it may seem like a daunting task. This text provides a thorough and comprehensive exposition of all the topics contained in a classical graduate sequence in numerical analysis. With an emphasis on theory and connections with linear algebra and analysis, the book shows all the rigor of numerical analysis. Its high level and exhaustive coverage will prepare students for research in the field and become a valuable reference as they continue their career. Students will appreciate the simple notation, clear assumptions and arguments, as well as the many examples and classroom-tested exercises ranging from simple verification to qualifying exam-level problems. In addition to the many examples with hand calculations, readers will also be able to translate theory into practical computational codes by running sample MATLAB codes as they try out new concepts.

### Availability

The electronic version of the book can be found on Cambridge Core [here](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108942607). Please (pray hands) ask your university library to purchase campus-wide access to the electronic version from Cambridge Core for you and your students.

If you are more of an old-school type, the hardback can be purchased on Amazon (in the United States and Europe) and directly from Cambridge University Press. If you use this [flyer](https://github.com/stevenmwise/stevenmwise.github.io/blob/master/files/flyer.pdf), you can get 20% off.

### Errata

No book that can be written can be written without errors. Our book has a few of them (wink). You can get the errata file from the GitHub repo for the book [here](https://github.com/stevenmwise/ClassicalNumericalAnalysis/blob/main/errata/bookErrata.pdf). Errors, typos and inconsistencies can be reported to either Abner or me. See my email address below. We greatly appreciate any feadback you have to give about the book.

### Codes

There are several Matlab codes that are listed in the book, and these may be retrieved from the GitHub repo: [stevenmwise/ClassicalNumericalAnalysis](https://github.com/stevenmwise/ClassicalNumericalAnalysis). In addition, you can obtain the Matlab codes used to generate the tables and figures dispayed in the book. We plan to add more codes and supplementary material over time to the repo.

### Solutions

We are working on a partial solutions manual, though it may not be ready until 2024/5. If you are an instructor teaching from the book, feel free to inquire about the status of the solutions project. We would be glad to hear from you.
