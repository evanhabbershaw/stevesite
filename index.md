## About

### Short Biography
Some stuff... this section is not changed online...why not?

### Research
I work in the intersection of numerical analysis, partial differential equations, and soft matter physics. I build models to study heat, mass, and current flow and the formation of interfaces in complex fluids and materials, and I design efficient numerical methods to get approximate solutions.

### Citations
My citation information can be found in the Google Scholar, Scopus, and other links below, and my UTK Faculty Profile can be found [here](https://faculty.utk.edu/Steven.Wise). I was recognized by Web of Science as a highly cited researcher in [2020](https://recognition.webofscience.com/awards/highly-cited/2020/) and [2022](https://recognition.webofscience.com/awards/highly-cited/2022/).
