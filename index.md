#### Research
I work in the intersection of numerical analysis, partial differential equations, and soft materials physics. I build models to study heat, mass, and current flow and the formation of interfaces in complex fluids and materials, and I design effiecient numerical methods to get approximate solutions.

#### Short Biography
I have been a professor of mathematics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, since 2007. Before that I was a postdoc at UC, Irvine, in Orange County California, where I worked with John Lowengrub and Vittorio Cristini on complex fluids, crystal microstructure, and cancer progression. I got a BS degree in mathematics in 1996 from Clarion University and did graduate work in mathematics at Virginia Tech and Penn State. I recieved my PhD in 2003 from the University of Virginia, where I studied engineering physics.

I mostly teach courses in numerical analysis, and, with Abner Salgado, I wrote a graduate-level textbook on the subject entitled "Classical Numerical Analysis: A Comprehensive Course," published by Cambridge University Press. You can check it out on Amazon or Cambridge Core. I also teach some courses in analysis and PDE.
